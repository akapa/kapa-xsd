##What's this

Just a simple function library for working with XSD DOM documents in Javascript. Supports things like looking up `<element>`s, type definitions (`<simpleType>` and `<complexType>`), looking up restricted parent types, reading facets, etc.

This is a very early, experimental version, should make it better as I proceed.

##Requirements

Defined in a [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) format, so you need an AMD loader.

##Documentation

All the methods are documented with [JSDoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc), you can find the generated HTML documentation in the **docs** folder.
